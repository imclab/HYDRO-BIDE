"""  UNDER HEAVY CONSTRUCTION. BIOGEOGRAPHIC MONOD MODEL  """

"""  The following is a simulation-based combination of ecological neutral theory and
     the Monod chemostat model of microbial growth. There is 1 source, 1 community,
     and 1 outlet. The model is spatially implicit. Like the Monod model, growth is
     influenced by the concentration of a limiting substrate in the medium.
     
     MONOD EQUATION: mu = mu_max * ( S / (Ks + S))
     
     S = concentration of a limiting substrate or resource
     mu = specific growth rate, increase in cell mass per unit time, grams of cells per gram of cell per hour
     mu_max = max. specific growth rate, nutrient-saturated reproductive rate
     Ks = half-saturation coefficient; S when mu/mu_max = 0.5., concentration at which Âµ is one-half its maximum
     
     Here, community dynamics are NOT necessarily neutral but they DO have a stochastic component that maintains a
     non-deterministic competition for limiting resources among many distinct species. This means that
     individuals are still picked at random to immigrate, reproduce, emigrate, etc. but according to
     probabilities that may or may not differ among species (i.e. neutral or non-neutral).  
     
     The inflow of a limiting resource and propagules will remain constant through time and so will the volume
     of the environment. Volume, inflow rate, proportion of active individuals, and concentration of inflowing
     resources all influence resource concentration. Resource concentration influences specific growth rate (mu).
     Mu can be translated to a per capita probability of reproducing in a given time step (during which all
     individuals could theoretically reproduce if S was not limiting).   
     
     In a given time period when individuals can either reproduce or not, and the lack of reproduction
     implies dormancy and not death (outflow captures death + emigration):
         
         1. Let Pr be the per capita probability of reproducing
                  
         2. Let Smax be the smallest resource concentration required for mu_max
         
         3. At a concentration S at or above Smax, mu = mu_max & Pr = 1.0
               i.e. everybody is expected to reproduce during a period when everybody
                    has the opportunity, Malthusian growth
         
         4. Let there be a threshold on resource concentration (Smin) at which, growth/reproduction
              does not occur. In this case, individuals persist in the environment without growing/reproducing
              but do not die (i.e. effectively dormant).
              
         In a given time period when individuals can either reproduce or not, and the lack of reproduction
         implies dormancy and not death, this means:
                 
             The probability of being dormant (Pd) is one minus the probability of reproducing, Pd = 1-Pr 
                 
             In an infinitely large population (or neutral community), the probability of reproducing would 
             equal the portion of active individuals. Likewise, the probability of being dormant would equal
             one minus the probability of reproducing, i.e.
                 Pd = (D/N) = 1 - (A/N) = 1 - Pr   
         
             
             Knowing that:
                 at Smax, mu = mu_max & Pr = 1
                 at Smin, mu = 0 & Pr = 0
                 at Smin < S < Smax, 0 < mu < mu_max
                 
                 Proposition:
                 We can use S, Smax, Smin to derive Pr.
                 We can use Pr to 1.) sample the community, inducing dormancy and activity
                                  2.) derive expected size of dormant and active portions 
                                  3.) induce immigration (see below).
                 
                 Q. How do we find Pr?
                 A. Relate S, Smax, and Smin to Pr
                 
                 Account for the floor (Pr = 0 when S = Smin)
                     subtract Smin from each term:
                         S' = S - Smin
                         Smax' = Smax - Smin
                 
                 Account for the ceiling (Pr = 1 when S = Smax)
                     if S' > Smax':
                         Pr = (S' - (S' - Smax')) / Smax'
                     if Smin < S <= Smax: 
                         Pr = S'/Smax'
                         
                 Finally:
                     Pr = [(S' + Smax') - max(S', Smax')]/Smax' 
                     mu = mu_max * Pr
                     
     
     Dilution rate will determine rates of emigration and death, which will vary with the community size.
     When mu drops below a certain probability, things go dormant (or die)
     When mu is above a certain probability, dormant things can become active
     
     This model will capture aspects of:
     
     Tilman (2004). Niche tradeoffs, neutrality, and community structure: A stochastic theory of resource
     competition, invasion, and community assembly. PNAS, 101:10854-10861.
     
         Tilman (2004) recognizes the importance of niche differences and stochastic dynamics
     
     Pueyo S, Fangliang H & Zillio T (2007) The maximum entropy formalism and the idiosyncratic theory
     of biodiversity. Ecology Letters, 10:1017-1028.
     
         Whereas neutral theory ignores all species differences, the idiosyncratic theory of Pueyo et al. (2007) 
         ignores all species similarities. These represent the two ends of a continuum of possible models that
         produce realistic log-series like community structure.
