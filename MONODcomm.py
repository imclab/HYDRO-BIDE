"""  UNDER HEAVY CONSTRUCTION. BIOGEOGRAPHIC MONOD MODEL  """

"""  The following is a simulation-based combination of ecological neutral theory and
     the Monod chemostat model of microbial growth. There is 1 source, 1 community,
     and 1 outlet. The model is spatially implicit. Like the Monod model, growth is
     influenced by the concentration of a limiting substrate in the medium.
     
     MONOD EQUATION: mu = mu_max * ( S / (Ks + S))
     
     S = concentration of a limiting substrate or resource
     mu = specific growth rate, increase in cell mass per unit time, grams of cells per gram of cell per hour
     mu_max = max. specific growth rate, nutrient-saturated reproductive rate
     Ks = half-saturation coefficient; value of S when mu/mu_max = 0.5., the concentration at which Âµ is one-half
     of its maximum
     
     note: mu_max and Ks are empirical coefficients that can differ among species and ambient environmental conditions 
     
     Here, growth as in many neutral and community ecological models is per capita. population and community dynamics
     are NOT necessarily neutral but they ARE stochastic. This maintains a non-deterministic form of competition for
     limiting resources. This means that individuals are still picked at random to immigrate, die, reproduce, emigrate,
     etc. but according to probabilities that may or may not differ among species (i.e. neutral or non-neutral).  
     
     The model will simulate a community under varying resource concentration. The inflow of resources will remain
     constant, and so will the volume. But, due to changing community size, composition, and the number of dormant
     and active individuals, the concentration of limiting resource or substrate will change from one time period
     to the next. 
     
     Since the community will have active and dormant portions that vary in size and composition through time, and
     since the community will not be at a steady state, specific growth rate and dilution rate (volume/flow rate)
     will not be equivalent.
     
     The specific growth rate (mu) will actually be a probability of reproducing. This probability will be influenced
     by the concentration of resources in the environment (S). S will then be driven by the rate of inflow (r),
     volume of the environment (V), and concentration of resources in the inflowing medium, as well as by the size of
     the active portion of the community in the previous time step.  """
